## DESCRIPTION:

**Imbox** is a system to provide a file hosting service. It offers [1] cloud storage, [2] file synchronization, and [3] cross-platform client application.

**Imbox** consists of two parts: the [imbox-client](https://github.com/jaiyalas/imbox-client) and the [imbox-server](https://github.com/teddywinglee/imbox-server). They both require the basic library [imbox-infra](https://github.com/jaiyalas/imbox-infra) which defines and provides essential data structures and tools. The [imbox-client](https://github.com/jaiyalas/imbox-client) also needs to import another package, the [imbox-client-network](https://github.com/teddywinglee/imbox-client-network), to handle connections between client and server.

!!**This repository is the server-part of the Imbox system.**!!

### Server

The easiest way is to use Eclipse to run this project. Simply import it (File>import>Existing project into workspace). Then, run it as Java application, VoilÃƒ !
		
Or, you can try to use maven

    > git clone https://github.com/teddywinglee/imbox-server.git
    > cd imbox-server/
    > mvn clean compile assembly:single

Please note that the "libs" folder is for maven, "lib" is for eclipse, download the one you need.

The server now runs on 8080 port, if you need to change it, please look at org.imbox.server.main.Imboxserver. The server now connects to localhost DB with default account and password, pleas change it at **org.imbox.database.db_connect**.
