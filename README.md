## DESCRIPTION:

Imbox is a system to provide a file hosting service. It offers [1] cloud storage, [2] file synchronization, and [3] cross-platform client application.

Imbox consists of two applications: [imbox-client](https://github.com/jaiyalas/imbox-client) and [imbox-server](https://github.com/teddywinglee/imbox-server). They both require [imbox-infra](https://github.com/jaiyalas/imbox-infra) which defines and provides essential data structures and tools. The [imbox-client](https://github.com/jaiyalas/imbox-client) also needs to import [imbox-client-network](https://github.com/teddywinglee/imbox-client-network) to handle connections between client and server.

## REQUIREMENTS:

* Java 8 (tested with Oracle Java 1.8.0_20-ea) 
* Maven 3 (tested with Apache Maven 3.2.1)
* MySQL (tested with MySQL 5.5, server only)
